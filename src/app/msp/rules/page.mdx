# Our Rules

### 1. Meeting Rules (May Differ Per Committee)

- **Confidentiality is key**: This means that anything shared within the meeting must not be told to anyone outside of the meeting. If someone leaks information, they will get a **Warn Level** increase, which means they will be closer to getting removed from OSC.
- **Attendance is mandatory**: Everyone must come to meetings unless they have a good reason not to. If someone misses more than two meetings without giving a reason, they will face penalties.
- **Excuses for absences**: If someone cannot come to a meeting, they must tell the committee head at least **24 hours before** the meeting. The only time they don’t have to do this is if there is an emergency.
- **Punctuality matters**: Being on time is important. If someone arrives late, they will be punished.
- **Conflict resolution**: If a person has a problem with the meeting time because it clashes with something else, they need to talk to the committee heads and fix it before the meeting starts.
- **Frozen members**: Some members might need a break for personal reasons. If a member is on an approved **freeze[^1]**, they will not receive tasks and will not be punished for missing meetings. A freeze can only last for **2 weeks**.

### 2. Event Rules

- **Commitment to roles**: If a person signs up for a role in an event, they must do it. If they don’t, they will be punished.
- **Maintain decorum**: When at an event, members should be respectful and not make noise so they don’t distract others.
- **Professionalism during interviews**: When conducting or attending an interview, members must dress properly and be on time.
- **Early arrival for interviews**: Members must arrive at least **10 minutes before** the scheduled interview time.
- **Confidentiality of interview results**: Nobody is allowed to talk about interview results or details. If a member tells anyone other than the committee head, they will be **fired immediately**.
- **Interview impartiality**: Members are not allowed to interview someone they personally know. If there is an emergency and they must do it, they **must get approval** from the head. If they show any favoritism, they will be **fired immediately**.

### 3. Warn Level System (**Disciplinary Levels**)

*(Board members receive double penalties, meaning if a normal member gets +1 Warn Level, a board member gets +2!)*

- **Unexcused absence**: If someone misses a meeting without giving a reason, they will get **+1 Warn Level**.
- **Late task submission (without an excuse)**: If someone doesn’t finish their task on time without a reason, they will get **+1 Warn Level**, and they will still have to complete the task.
- **Late arrival to meetings**: Members who arrive late will have to pay **5 LE for every 5 minutes they are late** \{UP TO 15 LE ONLY\}
- **Unwanted clingy behavior**: If a member bothers another person too much, they will get **+3 Warn Levels** because this is against OSC’s values.

#### What Happens at Each Warn Level:

- **Warn Level 0**: All clear.
- **Warn Level 1**: Just a small warning, no big punishment yet.
- **Warn Level 2**: The person will be watched closely, and they might get extra work.
- **Warn Level 3**: This is the final warning before being removed from OSC.
- **Warn Level 4**: **The person is kicked out of OSC.**

**Can a person lower their Warn Level?** Yes! If they behave well and show improvement over time, they can lose some Warn Levels.

> **Note:** The money collected from penalties is allocated as extra funding for OSC events and activities. These rules exist to instill discipline and punctuality among OSC members.

### 4. Rewarding System

- **Creative ideas are rewarded**: If someone comes up with a helpful or creative idea, they will be rewarded with *Mohsens[^2]*.
- **Best task of the week & event contribution**: The person who does the best task or helps the most at an event will get *Mohsens*.
- **Best Member of the Month**:
  - If a person works very hard, they may be named **Best Member of the Month**.
  - Their photo will be posted on the OSC Facebook page or in the OSC Crew group.
  - They will receive **3 Super Mohsens[^3]**.
- **Best Member of an Event**:
  - If someone helps a lot in a big event, they will receive **2 Super Mohsens[^3]**.
- **Helping Other Committees**:
  - If a person helps another committee complete its work, they will earn **15 Mohsens[^2]**.
- **Mohsens Reset Every Month**:
  - Every month, everyone’s *Mohsens[^2]* will reset to **zero**.
  - The previous points will still be saved to track the best member of the whole season.
- **Encouraging committees**:
  - Committee heads should encourage their members to work harder.
  - The **VPs** can give some **Super Mohsens[^3]** to committees as rewards.

### 5. Merging Committees[^4]

- **Eligibility**:
  - A person must complete at least **one season** in their first committee before they can merge into another one.
  - They must also show that they are performing well in their current committee before merging.
- **Limits**:
  - A person can only merge into **one additional committee per half-season**.
- **Performance expectations**:
  - After merging, the person must continue working hard in **both** committees.
  - If they do not, they will be removed from the new committee they merged into.
- **Fixing time conflicts**:
  - If merging causes a time conflict, the member must solve it before attending any sessions.
- **Interview process**:
  - The person must have an interview with the **head and vice president** of the new committee.
  - **HR is not involved** in these interviews.

### 6. HR Committee Evaluation System (Sessions & Tasks)
- **HR Attendance Rule**: If an HR member cannot attend a meeting for the committee they are assigned to, they must inform the corresponding head in advance. After the session, they are required to track the meeting’s attendance and feedback online with the head to stay updated.
