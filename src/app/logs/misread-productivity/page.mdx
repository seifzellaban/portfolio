# How I Misread Productivity and Learned the Hard Way  

Most people get fired for slacking off, being unreliable, or just not giving a damn.  
Me? I managed to do the opposite, I got in trouble for working too much.  

At least, that is how I used to tell the story.  
Now that I have had distance, I realize it was not about "too much work." It was about me misunderstanding what leadership, teamwork, and boundaries actually mean.

## Chapter One: Mistaking Systems for Success  

Back then, I thought productivity meant building all the systems. I rolled out KPIs, spreadsheets, trainings, dashboards, you name it. And people genuinely liked it, which fed my belief that I was on the right path.  

But here is what I missed: just because a system works does not mean it is aligned with how the larger group operates. I was so focused on proving value through structure that I did not stop to ask, does this fit into the existing culture? Will this actually be adopted the way I imagine?  

Lesson learned: productivity is not about what you build. It is about what sticks.  


## Chapter Two: Confusing Initiative with Alignment  

When no one gave me tools, I built them myself. It felt heroic, "I will just fix what is broken." And to be fair, the tools worked. But instead of being seen as resourceful, I came across as reckless.  

I never asked permission. I did not check if what I was doing overlapped with someone elseâ€™s responsibilities. I just assumed results would justify everything.  

That was naive. Organizations, especially ones with committees or hierarchies, run on trust and alignment, not lone-wolf solutions.  

Lesson learned: initiative is only half the equation. The other half is collaboration.  


## Chapter Three: Misreading Deadlines and Boundaries  

I used to pride myself on answering late-night requests and grinding through impossible deadlines. But by doing that, I set a dangerous precedent: I taught people that I was always available.  

Then, when I pushed back and asked for reasonable timelines, it was jarring, for them and for me. I thought I was standing up for myself, but the truth is, I had already let things get out of hand by not setting boundaries from the start.  

Lesson learned: saying "yes" to everything is not leadership. It is just self-sabotage with a productivity bow on top.  


## Chapter Four: Leadership Is Not About Outshining  

The hardest pill to swallow? I thought leading was about doing more than everyone else. Training extra people. Fixing systems outside my scope. Carrying morale when others did not.  

But by trying to do it all, I blurred lines, threatened other roles, and without realizing it, created tension instead of harmony.  

Leadership is not about outworking or outsmarting. It is about creating space where everyone can succeed, not proving you can do it alone.  

Lesson learned: overextension can look like overstepping.  


## Chapter Five: The Firing  

When they let me go, I felt betrayed. I told myself the story of being punished for caring too much. That was the version that made sense at the time.  

Now? I see it differently. I was not fired because I was "too productive." I was let go because I mistook motion for impact and effort for alignment.  

It does not make the exit less painful, but it does make it more understandable.  


## Epilogue: What I Carry Forward  

Looking back, I do not regret the effort, I regret not channeling it better. I learned that:  

- Systems are only valuable if people can and will use them.  
- Initiative without communication looks like rebellion.  
- Boundaries matter as much as output.  
- Leadership is about lifting, not overshadowing.  

I left with scars, sure. But I also left with lessons that will keep me from making the same mistakes twice.  

And if that was the cost of growth? Honestly, it was worth it.
