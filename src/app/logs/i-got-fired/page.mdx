# How I Got Fired for Being Overproductive

Most people get fired for the classics. You know the list: showing up late, ghosting responsibilities, swiping office pens by the dozen, or maybe just not doing the damn job.  
Me? Oh no, my story had to be different.

I got fired because I worked too much.  
Yes. Fired. For. Overproductivity.

Sounds like a bad joke, right? Like one of those sarcastic LinkedIn posts where someone pretends they were too good for their toxic company. But no, this is real. And it is a story worth telling, because I still wake up at night laughing at the absurdity of it all.

## Chapter One: The KPIs That Apparently Didn’t Exist

So here is how it all started. Picture me, an enthusiastic HR head, half a season deep into building a proper system for my team. I spent weeks training members, creating KPI sheets, running analysis, teaching people how to actually track performance, and, shockingly, people loved it.

We were organized. We were productive. We were finally in sync.

But then came the curveball:  
“Where are your tasks on Discord?”

See, I had them on Google Drive. They were there, they were accessible, they were being used every day. But apparently, unless something exists in the holy temple of Discord, it doesn’t exist at all.

It is like me saying, “Hey, I just baked you a cake,” and you replying, “Yeah, but did you put it in the fridge? No fridge? No cake.”

So, lesson learned: innovation doesn’t matter if you don’t play by the invisible, arbitrary rules.

## Chapter Two: The Audacity of Solving Problems

Now, here comes my favorite crime: making decisions.

Yes, I confess. I dared to take initiative.  
When I needed a system and nobody delivered, I built it myself. I am not even in the tech committee, but I know my way around code, so I pulled an all-nighter, got it working, and delivered a shiny new product that worked.

You would think I would get a pat on the back, maybe a “wow, thanks for saving the day.”  
Nope. What I got instead was:  
“Who gave you permission?”

I don’t know, maybe the basic survival instinct that kicks in when things need to get done? Maybe the fact that the committee ghosted me for months?

It is like being on a sinking ship, patching the hole with duct tape, and the captain saying, “Uh, excuse me, you’re not in the plumbing department.”

## Chapter Three: Midnight Deadlines and Superhuman Expectations

Then there were the deadlines. Oh, the deadlines.

I would get messages at 11 PM:  
“Hey, here is a task. Need it by tomorrow morning.”

Sure, because I clearly have no life outside this. I am just sitting by the phone, waiting for my next mission like a side character in Mission Impossible.

And when I dared to ask, _“Could I maybe know about this earlier?”_ the reply was basically:  
“Stop delaying tasks.”

Right. Because not owning a time machine is obviously a personal failure.

## Chapter Four: Support? Never Heard of It

Now, in theory, there is supposed to be a board that supports you. Guides you. Has your back.

In reality? My board was more like an obstacle course.

They would ambush me mid-session in front of my team, trying to embarrass me.  
They would question my methods, undermine my work, and casually suggest that my ideas were not “aligned.”

But here is the part that made it funny: my team didn’t buy it.  
They defended me. They spoke up. Because when you actually care about your people, when you work with them, not above them, they notice.

So imagine the frustration of the board: trying to villainize me, only to have my 17 members look at them like, “Yeah, nice try. We know what’s real.”

## Chapter Five: The Grand Exit

And then came the finale.

They called me up and said, with all the fake sweetness in the world:  
“You can say goodbye to your members before you leave. After all, you’ve been with them for a whole season.”

Ah yes, the kindness of letting me do a farewell tour. Like I was some washed-up football player being traded to another team.

I didn’t fight it. I just asked to be removed from all the groups before midnight. And funny enough, that was the first time in an entire season they approved a request instantly. Guess booting me was the easiest KPI they ever hit.

## The Real Crime

So here we are. Fired for building too much, caring too much, doing too much.

The irony is, they accused me of not doing my role. And maybe they are right, I wasn’t just doing my role. I was doing more than my role. I was helping other heads, training people outside my scope, fixing systems no one else would touch, and trying to keep morale alive when politics were tearing people apart.

But apparently, that is the biggest sin of all: daring to go beyond.

## Epilogue

I will be honest: it hurt. Not the firing itself, I will live. But the way it was handled, the way I was painted as the villain, the way months of effort were swept under the rug because it didn’t fit neatly into someone else’s version of control, that is the part that stings.

Still, I don’t regret a thing. My team is still my team. My work still speaks for itself. And if being “overproductive” is a fireable offense, then fine, guilty as charged.

Next time someone says “we’re a family here,” remember: sometimes families don’t hug you. Sometimes, they vote you off the island for cleaning the kitchen too well.
